## Abstract

This concept paper synthesises a decade of research culminating in _Epistemic Clientelism in Intimate Relationships_ (Kahl 2025a), presenting a concise overview of **epistemic psychology**—a new moral-cognitive framework uniting developmental, social, and clinical evidence under one relational grammar of knowing. It argues that knowledge emerges not from cognition alone but from fiduciary relations of trust, recognition, and moral reciprocity. Drawing on empirical studies across psychology and neuroscience, the paper shows that epistemic autonomy and dependence are co-regulated through patterns of recognition (ρ) and suppression (σ) established in early attachment and re-enacted in adult intimacy.

Longitudinal research (Ferreira et al., 2022; Nelson et al., 2014) links maternal frustration and sensitivity to children’s self-control and later social competence; cross-cultural work (Blair & Liu 2020; Wang & Chen 2023) demonstrates how moral grammars of recognition vary across familial and cultural systems; and neuro-affective evidence (Jakubiak & Feeney 2018) confirms that affectionate touch buffers stress and restores trust. These findings converge on a single insight: epistemic stability arises not from emotional compatibility but from ethical containment—the fiduciary regulation of asymmetry within relationships.

For psychology and psychiatry, this framework reframes trauma, dependency, and conflict as epistemic injuries: moral failures of recognition rather than affective disorders. By integrating empirical research with fiduciary ethics, epistemic psychology lays the groundwork for a science of mind rooted in care, candour, and moral reciprocity.
